# 1 - Minimum Falling Path Sum

This problem reminded me a little bit of the robing houses problem. So the goal is to go from the to of the given 2D array to the bottom by picking the smallest number in either the same column, the column to the left of the current one or the column to the right of it. So at any given instance you will have 3 options to choose from. In order to do this my approach would probably be to start at the second to the last row in the array. I would go accross the entire row and determine which column option(i-1,i,i+1) would be the option with the smallest cost and store that option in i another 2D array which only held the the total cost from the bottom row that point picking only the columns with the smallest values. so i guess it would actually be more like the edit distance problem now that I think about it. I would do that through the whole 2D array and when finished the smallest value in the top row would be the answer.
